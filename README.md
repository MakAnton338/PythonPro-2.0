At first home work we'll try to work with github and parse.
Parse going extremely good, but GitHub let me smoke. As they say "An oak is not felled at one stroke"

Parsing -  is the process of analyzing a string of symbols, either in natural language, computer languages or data structures, conforming to the rules of a formal grammar

GitHub - is place who save all difference between yr code now and previous one, and previous one, and... you know. Reposetories it's like trunk of the tree, branches - like a regular branches of this tree. On branches you save code, and after code looks good to your menthor, he merge branches to reposetories and save all changes.
